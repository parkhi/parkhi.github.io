# Engineering Portfolio

I work on backend systems with C/C++ and Python, building reliable data pipelines using PostgreSQL, Redis, FastAPI and more.  
This site collects write-ups of projects I’ve worked on and the design choices behind them.

## Case Studies

- **Crypto Data Backend (FastAPI · Redis · PostgreSQL)**  
  Daily workers fetch market data, normalize it, and store it in Postgres/Redis.  
  Endpoints serve cached results with authentication and admin log export.

- **CPAP Medical Device Data Platform (C++ · Kafka · MongoDB · NestJS)**  
  C++ service to extract device data, publish via Kafka, and expose REST APIs.  
  Stored daily/session statistics in MongoDB with role-based access control.
